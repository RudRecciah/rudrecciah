# Hey
I'm a pink parrot who likes code. I've been programming for the past three years, mostly in JS.

# Projects
### [Admincore](https://rudrecciah.dev/admincore)
With Admincore, you can moderate and administer your Spigot server with ease and simplicity. Report, punish, spectate, appeal, and manage your playerbase in-game quickly and without hassle.
### [Endcraft](https://rudrecciah.dev/osea)
EndCraft is a now open-source archive of a Minecraft server I've owned with some friends since 2013. Find maps, custom plugins, valuable data, and more in EndCraft's archive.
### [To The Moon Theory Wiki](https://rudrecciah.dev/ttm)
Being the main active theorizer of all Freebird games, I noticed theories were hard to keep track of and I would usually lose ones made by others. As a response, I decided to build a place for theories to exist and be easily accessable to anyone who might want to read some or use them to make their own.
### [Custom Query Stats](https://rudrecciah.dev/cqs)
Custom Query Stats is a plugin that stores player statistics in your server's MOTD. This way, a Spigot server can send player metadata to other services without the need for an HTTP server or similar solution.
